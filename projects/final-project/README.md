# Final Project
#### Out: 11/10/17 | Deadline: 12/8/17 11:00 AM 

### Overview 

In this project, you will tie together everything you have learned this semester. 

The application you will build is a "crowdsourced data application". 

You will utilze the technologies we learned (HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, Express, Handlebars, and MongoDB) to create an API and front-end website with interactivity for your data.

### Objectives

The purpose of this project is to create a fully functioning **"crowdsourced data application"**.

First, you must select a topic for your project to be on. Example topics could be (you cannot use any of these for your project): 

- Local Dogs for Adoption
- Movie Reviews
- UMD Clubs and Activities
- Rock Climbing Gyms

Topics should ideally be people/places/things that can be crowdsourced by users of your application. Throught this project specification, we will use **Local Dog for Adoption** as an example. 

This project is largely open ended. The only requirement is to satisfy all parts of the `Specifications` section below, which are broad and flexible. Outside of that, you are free to be creative and make something you are proud of. 

### Grading

You fill submit both the application source as well as a `documentation.md` file that documents how you implemented each part of the project. 

Grading will be done using the `documentation.md` file to test your application.

Each specificiation has two types of requirements: 
- (REQ): These are requirements **must** be followed. Failue to do so can result in up to 50% point deductions for the entire project. 
- (X pt): These specifications are worth X points.

### Setup

There is a provided a shell that has all the dependencies you need set up. We have also included several libaries you will need in `package.json`. Clone the shell and run `npm install`. 

### Specifications


1. **Data Format and Storage**

    - (REQ) Data should be stored in MongoDB (use mlab.com for ease)
    - (5 pt) Each schema should have _at least_ 5 fields (minimum one schema).
    - (5 pt) There should be at least one of each of the following field types:
        - String
        - Number
        - Array (of anything)

    In `documentation.md`, you must list each field and their respective types, as well as include the `mongoose schema`.
    
    **`documentation.md` example**:
    ```markdown
    
    ### 1. Data Format and Storage
    
    #### Dog

    Data fields:
    - `Field 1`: name               `Type: String`
    - `Field 2`: breed              `Type: String`
    - `Field 3`: image              `Type: String`
    - `Field 4`: age                `Type: Number`
    - `Field 5`: characteristics    `Type: [String]`

    Schema: 

    {
        name: {
            type: String,
            required: true
        },
        breed: {
            type: String,
            required: true
        },
        image: {
            type: String,
            required: true
        }, 
        age: {
            type: Number,
            required: true
        }, 
        characteristics: [String]
    }
    ```


2. **Add New Data**

    Users will need to be able to add data to your databse. Users will be able to   add data in two ways: 
    
    - (10 pt) Submitting an HTML form. The form should have an input for each data  field. 
    - (10 pt) Sending a `POST` request to an API endpoint. The API endpoint must    take in entry for each data field. 
    
    In `documentation.md`, you will need to include:
    - At which route the HTML form lives on the website
    - At which route the `POST` API endpoint can be accessed. 
    - An example Node.js `POST` request using the `request` module to the API   endpoint.
    
    **`documentation.md` example**:
    ```markdown
    ### 2. Add New Data
    
    HTML form route: `/addDog`
    POST endpoint route: `/api/addDog`
    
    Example Node.js POST request to endpoint: 
    var request = require("request");
    
    var options = { 
        method: 'POST',
        url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/addDog',
        headers: { 
            'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' 
        },
        form: { 
            name: 'Cupcake', 
            breed: 'German Shepherd',
            image: "http://i.imgur.com/iGLcfkN.jpg",
            age: 10,
            characteristics: ["Brown", "Black", "Sleepy", "Lazy"]
        } 
    };
    
    request(options, function (error, response, body) {
      if (error) throw new Error(error);
    
      console.log(body);
    });
    ```

3. **View Data**

    Users should be able to view all data in two ways: 
    
    - (REQ) The HTML pages should be generated using Handlebars
    - (10 pt) At the home `/` route, you should display every data point in an  HTML Page. 
    - (10 pt) At another API `GET` endpoint, you should return all data points as   JSON. 
    
    In `documentation.md`, you will need to include: 
    - The **route** for the API endpoint that returns all data. 
    
    
    **`documentation.md` example**:
    ```markdown
    ### 3. View Data
    
    GET endpoint route: `/api/getDogs`
    
    ```

4. **Search Data**

    Also on the home page, you should implement an **auto-updating search feature** . 
    
    Select an appropriate field to run your searches on. 
    
    When the user first visits the home `/` page, they should see all data points. 
    
    - (15 pt) As the user types in the search bar, filter the results on the page   to those that match the search query. The results should be **auto-updating**. This means that for every keystroke, the results should be updated. The page should NOT refresh while typing and searching. 
    - (5 pt) If there is no match, then display text indicating that there are no   matches. 
    
    Note: Feel free to use any **NPM Modules** to help you complete this task. 
    
    **Example:**
    
    I chose to implement search on Dog names. Suppose I have dogs `"nelson"`,  `"nelley"`, and `"noslen"`. As soon as I type `"Ne"` (without hitting enter), the  list should be filtered to only include `"nelson"` and `"nelley"`. If I type `"Nee"`, then I should see something like "There are no dogs with the name "Nee". 
    
    In `documentation.md`, you will need to include: 
    - Which field you chose to conduct the search on. If you pick a string field, please make sure it is case-insensitive.
    
    **`documentation.md` example**:
    ```markdown
    ### 4. Search Data
    
    Search Field: name

    ```

5. **Navigation Pages**

    On the home `/` page, you should also have a **navigation bar**. This navigation bar will have **5 links** (one of them should be home), and should be visible on every page. 

    The navigation bar links should filter your data in some way. 

    As an example, for the Dogs example, we could have: 
    - Home: All dogs
    - Select a Breed: Displays a list of breeds that you can use to filter. 
    - Young Dog: Lists all dogs younger than 4 years old. 
    - Random Dog: Showcases a random dog. 
    - Alphabetical Dogs: Lists all dogs in alphabetical order by name.

    (REQ) All additional pages must be rendered using handlebars. 

    (5 pt) 5 navigation bar links visible on each page (Hint: Use `main.handlebars`). 

    (15 pt) 5 pages linked to from the navigation bar that display the appropriate filtered data. 

    In `documentation.md`, you will need to include: 
    - Each of the navigation filters
    - The routes for each of the additional pages
    
    **`documentation.md` example**:
    ```markdown
    ### 5. Navigation Pages

    Navigation Filters
    1. Home -> `/`
    2. Select a Breed -> `/breed/:breed_name`
    3. Young Dog -> `/youngest`
    4. Random Dog -> `/random`
    5. Alphabetical Dogs -> `/alphabetical`
    
    ```

### Submission

We will be using [now](https://zeit.co/now) to submit one link per project. We will go over how to use this in class on 12/1.

### Additional Comments

You can use mlab for a free MongoDB instance. Read the instructions [here](http://google.com) for instructions.

Please ask questions if you are confused! Posting in piazza is a huge resource for everyone. This is a very general project, so we expect to clarify quite a bit.
