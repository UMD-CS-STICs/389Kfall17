# Week 2: JavaScript
--------------------

## What is Javascript?

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, programming language with first-class functions. It is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages. (Mozilla Developer Network)

Please refer to the `pre_class.md` resources to provide yourself with a introduction to the language.

During class, we will go over **objects** and **function**, which are very important for Javascript and will be used extensively in our full-stack applications. Therefore, a thorough understanding of them is required.

### Working with arrays and objects

We will build an example with students/Nelson and their ages.

Arrays in JavaScript are heterogeneous. This means that they can hold data of different types. For example, `var a = [1, 'hello', function () { return 1; }]` is valid even though the array has an integer, then a string, followed by a function..

First, we can create an array of student names (not heterogeneous):

```javascript
var names = ["Nelson", "Rachel", "Megan"];
```

If we need to print everyone's names, we can use a for loop. We can use a standard for loop or a for-each loop.

A for-each would look like the following:
```javascript
// Output:
// 0
// 1
// 2
for(var i in names) {
    console.log(i); // console.log() is how we print to the console
}
```
We see that `i` contains the index of each element, not the value. This means that if we wanted to print all the elements in the array using this type of loop, we would have to do something like the following:
```javascript
// Output:
// "Nelson"
// "Rachel"
// "Megan"
for(var i in names) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
}
```
A standard for loop looks very similar to java's:
```javascript
// Output:
// "Nelson"
// "Rachel"
// "Megan"
for(var i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    console.log(names[i]);
}

// Exercise: Print out contents of list in reverse order.
```
Now, we will move onto functions. Consider the function `greet(name)`.

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello " + name);
}

greet("Nelson"); // logs "Hello Nelson"
```
In order to define this function, we used the `function` keyword followed by the function name, and then a comma-separated list of all the variable we expect. Notice how we do not specify the type; this is because Javascript is dynamically typed.

Similarly, we could have functions that do other operations on names:

```javascript
function reverser(name) {
    var arr = name.split("");
    arr = arr.reverse() // reverses the array
    arr= arr.join(""); // joins all the elements with "" (empty string)
    console.log(arr);
}

function printFirstLetter(name) {
    console.log(name.charAt(0));
}

reverser("Nelson"); // logs "nosleN"
printFirstLetter("Nelson"); // logs 'N'
```

We can build a function that will run one of our "name operators" on each value of an array.

First, let's write a function `applyToArray` that simply takes in one argument: `operator`.

```javascript
function reverser(name) {
    console.log(name.split("").reverse().join(""));
}

function applyToArray(operator) {
    console.log(operator);
}

// [Function: reverse]
applyToArray(reverser);

// Exercise: What would applyToArray print out if I passed in "Hello"?
```

What exactly did we do here? We passed a reference to the function `reverser` into `applyToArray`. JavaScript has **first class functions**, which means functions are treated like any other variable, and therefore can be passed around as parameters.

This means we can do almost anything with functions, such as **creating an array of functions**.

```javascript
function hi() {
    console.log("hi");
}

function bye() {
    console.log("bye");
}

function nelson() {
    console.log("nelson");
}

var funcs = [hi, bye, nelson];

// Exercise: Iterate through this array, and execute each function.
```

We don't have to declare the functions before putting them in the array. We can define them **inline anonymously**;

```javascript
var funcs = [
                function() {
                    console.log("hi");
                },
                function() {
                    console.log("bye");
                },
                function() {
                    console.log("nelson")
                }
            ];
```

Now that we know we can use functions in JavaScript, we can go back to our "name operation" example.

We can use the function `reverser` inside `applyToArray` by passing it in as an argument, and then calling it just like we would any other function:
```javascript
function reverser(name) {
    console.log(name.split("").reverse().join(""));
}

function applyToArray(operator) {
    operator("Nelson");
}

applyToArray(reverser); // Logs "nosleN"
```

Notice how `operator` inside `applyToArray` refers to `reverser`, since we passed in `reverser` to `applyToArray` as the parameter corresponding to `operator`.

This is a very powerful construct, and we will use it often throughout this course.

Next, let's add another parameter to `applyToArray` to take in an array:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hello " + name);
}

function reverser(name) {
    console.log(name.split("").reverse().join(""));
}

function applyToArray(arr, operator) {
    var name = arr[0];
    operator(name);
}

var names = ["Nelson", "Rachel", "Megan"];
applyToArray(names, reverser); // Logs "nosleN"
applyToArray(names, greet); // Logs "Hello Nelson"
```

We can change the functionality of `applyToArray` just by passing in a different operator function, allowing it to be very flexible. Now, `applyToArray` can be used in a variety of situations.

Let's change `applyToArray` to actually run the `operator` over the entire array:
```javascript
function reverser(name) {
    console.log(name.split("").reverse().join(""));
}

function applyToArray(arr, operator) {
    for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        operator(arr[i]);
    }
}

var names = ["Nelson", "Rachel", "Megan"];
applyToArray(names, reverser);
// Output:
// nosleN
// lehcaR
// nageM
```

To see how flexible `applyToArray` is, let's use it in another example.

```javascript
var num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
applyToArray(num, function(i){
    console.log(i * i);
});
// Output:
// 1
// 4
// 9
// 16
// 25
```

There is a function `forEach()` for arrays that applies an inputted function to each value in the array.

We have basically already implemented this. Try writing your own version of forEach.

```javascript
var num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

num.forEach(function(val) {
    console.log(val);
})
// Output:
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5

// Exercise:
function myForEach(arr, func){
    for (var i in arr) {
        func(arr[i]);
    }
}
```

Let's make things a little more interesting. What if I want to save information about each person's age? We can make an **object**.

Let us start by constructing an object.

```javascript
// This is our constructor.
var people = {};
```
Now, we need to insert data into the object.
```javascript
people.Nelson = 90;
people.Rachel = 18;
people.Megan = 20;

// The following also works.

people['Nelson'] = 90;
people['Rachel'] = 18;
people['Megan'] = 20;

console.log(people); // logs: { Nelson: 90, Rachel: 18, Megan: 20 }
```

Similarly, we could have created the object like this.
```javascript
// Just like a hash with key/value pairs.
var people = {
    Nelson: 90,
    Rachel: 18,
    Megan: 20
};
```
Objects can also be nested within one another. Let's take a look in this context.
```javascript
var people = {
    Nelson: {
        age: 90,
        gender: 'male'
    },
    Rachel: {
        age: 18,
        gender: 'female'
    },
    Megan: {
        age: 20,
        gender: 'female'
    }
};

// You can access the interior elements with two ways.
console.log(people['Nelson']); // logs: { age: 90, gender: 'male' }
console.log(people.Nelson); // logs: { age: 90, gender: 'male' }
```

If we want to iterate across all the keys, we can do something similar to what we did in arrays.

```javascript
// Output:
// Nelson
// Rachel
// Megan
for (var name in people) {
    console.log(name);
}
```

Now, we will print out all of the ages of everyone we have saved.
```javascript
// Output:
// Nelson's age is 90.
// Rachel's age is 18.
// Megan's age is 20.
for (var name in people) {
    console.log(`${name}'s age is ${people[name].age}.`);
}

// Exercise: Why would doing people.name.age not work?
```

The objects can have values that are functions.
```javascript
people.Nelson.getAgeSquared = function () {
    return people.Nelson.age * people.Nelson.age;
}

console.log(people.Nelson.getAgeSquared());
// logs: 8100

people.Nelson.age = 12;

console.log(people.Nelson.getAgeSquared());
// logs: 144

// Exercise: What would happen if I ran 'people.Nelson.getAgeSquared = 2' followed by 'people.Nelson.getAgeSquared()'?

// Could have also done:
// getAgeSquared: function() { return people.Nelson.age * people.Nelson.age }
// Exercise: this?
```

Below are two final (difficult!) exercises to solidify your understanding.

```javascript
/*
 * 1. Create a function "add" that would be able to execute "add(2)(4) --> 6".
 * Notice how the arguments are separated by parentheses.
 */
 function add(num){
     return function(next){
         return next + num;
     }
 }

/*
 * 2. Create a function add that would successfully be able to execute
 * add(2)(5)(); --> 7
 * add(2)(4)(2)(); --> 8
 * There could be >= 2 numbers in parentheses, and there will always be an empty
 * () at the end.
 */
 function add(num){
     if (num == undefined) return;
     return function(y){
         if (y == undefined) return num;
         return add(y + num);
    }
 }
 ```
